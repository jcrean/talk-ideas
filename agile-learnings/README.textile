MS Project Plans are a Fairy Tale: How Agile Gets you the best aspects of a sober reality and a higly productive organization.

Here is hwo I see traditional project plans:

  - waterfall
  - fairy tale (are you fo'serious? you can predict the future? gimme some stock tips!)
    oh, so you're a psychic?
  - What happens when your psychic powers fail?
    Adjust the project plan? (screaming guy picture)
    How many times can you do this in a week without loss of sanity or being brought up on homicide charges?
    In a day? 
  - But we thought everything was going well....
    Because adjustments are hard to make, it is hard to admit that you're not superman
  - What about that critical feature that we just realized needs to get developed?
    Just add it in! after all, we have an entire MONTH for thiso
